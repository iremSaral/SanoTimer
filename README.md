# **SanoTimer: The Smart Irrigation Solution**

SanoTimer is my graduation project developed for a remotely controlled irrigation system. I chose to use React Native and Firebase technologies for this project. I used the Expo framework to develop the mobile application and the Firebase database to store the necessary data. These data are converted into appropriate commands to be read by Arduino. You can access the Arduino code from a [separate repository](https://github.com/iremSaral/SanoTimer-ArduinoCode). The application interfaces provided below are designed by myself using Figma.

## Features

- Users need to enter a password to log in to the mobile application.
- When the manual mode is activated, the user can adjust a selected valve to remain open for a desired duration.
- In test mode, the connected valves in the system are sequentially opened and closed in two-minute intervals.
- Users can save programs in the system to run at specific time intervals.
- Users can reset the system to delete all saved programs.
- Users can view a list of saved programs.
- The application supports both English and Turkish languages.
